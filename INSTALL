You will need a ruby and rails install >= 2.0.2, no gems ;-) but of course you can contribute if you add
to the app more features.
Use my mysql schema instead of the one in the howto here:
http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/virt-mail-howto.xml

1. the first think you may want to do is edit your config/database.yml and put mysql username and password
and maybe edit  were the mysql sock lives so rails can find it.
2. then have rails create the database, for this go into the root of the application and type
	rake db:create && rake db:migrate
this will create your database and tables! that easy yes, active directory is something to love..
3. test it, you can pull up a test server running from the root of the app the command:
	./script/server
this will open a webserver on localhost:3000 go there and you will see the loging page.
the default user is admin@admin.org and password admin PLEASE ERASE THIS USER and create one for yourself firt.
